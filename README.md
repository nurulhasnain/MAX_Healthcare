Introducing the MAX Hospital Dashboard!

I am thrilled to announce the completion of a significant project: the MAX Hospital Dashboard, a comprehensive data visualization tool that brings insights from a vast dataset of over 310,000+ patient records. This project was an incredible journey, and I'm excited to share a glimpse of my experience with you all!

ðŸ§¹ **Data Cleaning Adventure**: The journey began with tackling a colossal dataset. It took approximately 8 hours to meticulously clean the data, ensuring accuracy and reliability. The size of the dataset posed a challenge, but overcoming it was the first step towards creating meaningful insights.

ðŸ“Š **Five Pages, Endless Insights**:
1. **Hospital Analytics**: Delve into key metrics related to hospital operations, patient inflow, and overall performance.
2. **Financial Analytics**: Gain insights into the financial aspects of the hospital, including revenue streams and cost distribution.
3. **Risk Analytics**: Identify potential risk factors and patterns in patient data to enhance decision-making and preventive strategies.
4. **Department Analytics**: Explore performance metrics for different hospital departments, optimizing resource allocation and patient care.
5. **Patients Analytics**: Analyze patient demographics, treatment costs, and trends to personalize patient care and improve outcomes.

ðŸš€ **Overcoming Challenges**: Designing this dashboard wasn't without its hurdles. The sheer volume of data required careful handling.

**NOTE- Please be advised that the data may not be accurate, as it was sourced from a third-party. This dashboard is intended for illustrative purposes only; the data presented may not be correct**.
